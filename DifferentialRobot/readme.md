# Differential Wheeled Robot - Kinematics and Control

This project focuses on the kinematic modeling and control of a **Differential Wheeled Robot**, including both continuous and discrete dynamics, as well as a simple control approach using the **Line of Sight** method.

## Overview

A differential wheeled robot uses two independently driven wheels for movement and turning. This type of robot is widely used in mobile robotics due to its simplicity and maneuverability.

### Key Concepts Covered:

* **Position and Orientation modeling**
* **Continuous Dynamics equations**
* **Discrete Dynamics modeling**
* **Control Approach using Line of Sight method**

## Contents

### 1. Position and Orientation

Defines the robot's pose using:

* $x, y$ : Cartesian coordinates of the robot.
* $\theta$ : Orientation angle of the robot with respect to the reference axis.

### 2. Continuous Dynamics

Formulates the robot's continuous-time kinematic model:

$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{x} = v \cos(\theta) \\
\dot{y} = v \sin(\theta) \\
\dot{\theta} = \omega
\end{cases}
$$

Where:

* $v$: Linear velocity.
* $\omega$: Angular velocity.

### 3. Discrete Dynamics

Discrete approximation using time steps $T_s$:

$$
\begin{cases}
x_{k+1} = x_k + v_k \cos(\theta_k) T_s \\
y_{k+1} = y_k + v_k \sin(\theta_k) T_s \\
\theta_{k+1} = \theta_k + \omega_k T_s
\end{cases}
$$

### 4. Control Idea (Line of Sight)

A simple **Line of Sight (LOS)** control approach:

* The robot moves towards a predefined **target point**.
* The angular error between the robot's current heading and the line connecting to the target is minimized.
* Velocity and angular velocity are adjusted to reduce the distance and orientation error.

## Target

Define the target location in the workspace for the robot to navigate towards using the above control method.
